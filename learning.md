### "Create key failed: policy evaluator unavailable; fail-closed"
- **Cause:** keycore reads `POLICY_ENGINE_URL` to find the policy service. It was
  never set in `docker-compose.yml`, so keycore's policy evaluator fell back to
  the **deny-all** evaluator (because `KEYCORE_POLICY_FAIL_CLOSED` defaults true)
  and denied *every* key operation with this exact message.
- **Second layer:** the policy service requires a valid **Bearer JWT** on every
  request (`pkgjwtauth.MustWrap`), but keycore's `HTTPPolicyClient` only set
  `Content-Type` — so even with the URL set it would get `401` and still fail
  closed.
- **Fix:** set `POLICY_ENGINE_URL=http://policy:8040` in keycore's compose env,
  and make the policy client **forward the caller's bearer token** (and
  `X-Tenant-ID`). keycore already stashes the raw token in context as
  `rawBearerTokenCtxKey`; the client now reads it and sets `Authorization`.
- **Why forwarding works:** all services share the cluster-wide
  `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_B64`, so a token signed by the auth service validates at the
  policy service unchanged. Service-to-service identity = propagate the caller's
  JWT, not a separate service token.
- **General principle:** fail-closed services turn *missing wiring* into a total
  outage, not a silent bypass. When "every operation is denied," suspect an
  unwired/unreachable dependency before suspecting data/permissions.

### Verifying auth paths without clobbering a user's credential
- To confirm keycore→policy auth, don't reset the admin password (the user may
  have already set their own). Any **valid JWT** satisfies the policy
  middleware, so log in as the bootstrap **cli-user** (password in `.env` as
  `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_CLI_PASSWORD`) and call `/policy/evaluate` directly — a `200`
  with a `decision` proves the path; a `401` proves it's still broken.

### Default admin credential & forced first-login change
- Default is `admin`/`admin`, safe only because the seeded admin has
  `MustChangePassword=true` and login then issues a JWT **scoped to
  `auth.password.change`** — the default can do nothing but rotate itself.
- `bootstrapDefaultAdmin` is **one-shot / idempotent**: it never overwrites an
  existing user. On an upgraded deployment the old admin password persists and
  `admin`/`admin` is rejected. Recover with `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_RESET_ADMIN=true`
  for one restart, then unset it (so a later restart can't clobber the rotated
  password). Keep `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_FORCE_PASSWORD_CHANGE=true` in real envs.

### The dashboard is a build artifact — "I don't see it" usually means stale build
- Source changes (tab merges, the Threat & Exposure console, etc.) are **not
  live until the dashboard container is rebuilt and redeployed**:
  `docker compose up -d --build dashboard`. Then hard-refresh the browser
  (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R) to drop the cached bundle.
- Verify what's actually served by grepping the bundle inside the container
  (`/usr/share/nginx/html/assets/*.js`) for expected/removed label strings,
  rather than trusting the source tree.
- The dashboard auth path is controlled by `public/config/ui-auth.json`:
  `prefer_backend_auth` (use the real auth service) vs `allow_local_fallback`
  (local `ui-auth.json` credentials). Backend mode relies on the auth service's
  `must_change_password` response.

### Merging dashboard tabs
- A "merge" is a wrapper component with a segmented control that renders the
  existing child tabs as sub-views, plus cleanup of every reference:
  `VectaDashboardV3Shell.tsx` (lazy import, component map, TITLES, nav array),
  `config/moduleRegistry.ts` (feature gate), and the FeatureKey/TabId unions.
  Remove genuinely redundant tabs entirely (e.g. Shamir Key Recovery is
  subsumed by guardian-quorum Escrow); fold unique functionality, drop overlap
  (e.g. the `rotate` action left scheduled-jobs once rotation policies own it).
