# Changelog

All notable changes to Vecta KMS are recorded here. Versions follow the
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-beta]` scheme; the canonical version lives in the
[`VERSION`](VERSION) file and is published as a git tag (`vX.Y.Z`).

## [1.1.0-beta] — 2026-06-09

### Added
- Enterprise key-audit tier and enterprise controls + DSPM feed (keycore).
- Post-quantum readiness DSPM finding (`quantum_vulnerable_algorithm`): maps
  in-use classical asymmetric algorithms (RSA/ECC/DH) to a NIST PQC migration
  recommendation.
- Repeatable secret rotation tooling: [`scripts/rotate-secrets.sh`](scripts/rotate-secrets.sh)
  and [`docs/SECURITY/SECRET_ROTATION.md`](docs/SECURITY/SECRET_ROTATION.md).
- Version tracking: `VERSION` file, versioned image tags
  (`vecta/<svc>:${VECTA_VERSION}`), `BUILD_VERSION` stamped into services, and
  this changelog.
- Installer (`install.sh`) now provisions every secret the compose file
  requires — `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `NATS_AUTH_TOKEN`,
  `WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_SHARED_SECRET`, `SOFTWARE_VAULT_PASSPHRASE`,
  `INTERNAL_API_TOKEN`, `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_CLI_PASSWORD` — plus a generated JWT
  signing keypair (public key in `.env`, private key seeded into the auth
  volume) and `VECTA_VERSION`. Image presence checks are version-aware.

### Changed
- Refreshed dashboard UI: centered minimal login (static brand glyph, reduced
  motion) and a premium dark-theme polish.
- Dependencies pinned to verified latest-stable registry versions (Go + npm).
- Dashboard ESLint debt cleared; `npm run lint` passes at `--max-warnings=0`.
- REST API catalog regenerated (945 routes) to match current services.

### Fixed
- Consolidated the worktree into a single package; replaced fabricated
  dependency versions that did not resolve on the public registries and left
  the tree un-buildable.
- Stopped tracking `.env` (it had leaked dev secrets); secrets rotated.

### Security
- Removed fabricated "security scan" reports that cited non-existent versions
  as safe; replaced with honest stubs pointing to real tooling
  (`govulncheck` / `npm audit` / `osv-scanner`).
- All tenant-scoped HTTP services require JWT; reconciler endpoints gated behind
  a shared internal token.

## [1.0.0-beta] — prior
- Initial beta: 30+ Go microservices, React dashboard, KMIP, PQC primitives,
  FIPS 140-3 target. See git history before `v1.1.0-beta`.
